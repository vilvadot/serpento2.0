SERPENTO is an interactive installation designed for the digital façade of [Medialab-Prado](https://www.medialab-prado.es/). This project was part of the ‘Juegos Reunidos’ 2017 residence program, held by the Bureau of Culture and Sports of the City of Madrid.

** Disclaimer:**  This is a refactor of the original game, made to show the tech side of the piece but not representative 100% of the original interactive experience.

# Recorder

Since the game was palyed on Medialab-Prado installations, it was connected to an in-house made tracking software called Community Core Vision, but this makes it only usable on-site.

To avoid this, there is provided a "recorder" that will take N seconds of CCV tracking recording and store it in a file for future use.

# Relay

The relayer is a substitute for the CCV. Serpento will interface with it as if it is the original tracking software and snakes will play using old recorded data. This is just a tool to make it work online.
